# World Bank Education Data Analysis

This repository contains SQL queries used for analyzing **World Bank** education data, specifically focusing on key education metrics like **enrollment rates**, **gender equity**, and **literacy trends** across various income groups and regions. The analysis spans the years **2000â€“2022** using publicly available data on Google BigQuery.

## Queries Included

### 1. **Tracking Education Progress by Income Group**
- **Goal:** Analyze how primary and secondary school enrollment rates differ across World Bank income groups from 2000 to 2022.
- **Key Metrics:** Primary and secondary education enrollment rates (SE.PRM.ENRR, SE.SEC.ENRR)
- **SQL:** Query aggregating enrollment rates by income group over the years.

### 2. **Education Equity Across Regions**
- **Goal:** Identify regions with the largest disparities in gender-based enrollment in secondary education in 2014.
- **Key Metrics:** Female and male secondary school enrollment rates (SE.SEC.ENRR.FE, SE.SEC.ENRR.MA)
- **SQL:** Query to compute the difference in enrollment rates between genders across regions.

### 3. **Detecting and Understanding Anomalies in Education Data**
- **Goal:** Identify countries with outlier education indicators (very high or low) for secondary education enrollment (SE.SEC.ENRR).
- **Key Metrics:** Secondary education gross enrollment ratio (SE.SEC.ENRR)
- **SQL:** Query to detect statistical outliers using z-scores.

### 4. **Literacy Trends Over Time**
- **Goal:** Explore how adult literacy rates have evolved in low-income countries since 2000 and identify characteristics of countries with slow improvement.
- **Key Metrics:** Adult literacy rate (SE.ADT.LITR.ZS)
- **SQL:** Query tracking changes in literacy over time.

### 5. **Curriculum or Education System Focus by Region**
